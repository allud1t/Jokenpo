# Jokenpô Game

- It is a small personal project as part of learning the Kotlin language. 🤓
- There are some basic concepts and structures learned until the time of the initial commit. 📚
- The game simulates, in the JVM, three rounds of stone 🏔️, paper 📜, and scissors ✂️.
- If there is a tie, new rounds will take place until a player managed to pass the scoreboard. 🏓
- The instructions for the terminal are in Portuguese 🇧🇷 and the program only reads entries in Portuguese from the user. 🗣️
- This code has the possibility to be committed with optimizations in the future. 🏋🏻
